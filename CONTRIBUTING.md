# Contributing
Bugfix Pull Requests are always welcome. If you want to implement a feature, it is advised get in touch first, to make sure your feature is in line with the direction Refloat development is heading.

## Commit Messages
Use descriptive (but succinct) commit title. For non-trivial commits, add a short commit description with any due explanation.

If the commit fixes a bug or adds a feature that should be mentioned in the changelog, add a `Fix:` or `Feature:` [git trailer](https://alchemists.io/articles/git_trailers) respectively.

Note the trailers need to go at the end of the commit description and be preceded by an empty line.

A limitation of trailers is they don't support formatted multiline content. A workaround is in place for this, use this format for multiline changelog records:

```
commit 1a5b1e0950df424eb9a7876ea2af57f3f652922f

    Swap the firmware internal imu filter and the true pitch filter

    Use the firmware internal filter as the "true pitch" filter, with a
    "standard" Mahony setup. Change the Float package "true pitch" filter to
    act as the main balancing filter with the special Mahony kp ~= 2.

    Feature: Separate Mahony KP configuration between package and firmware
     >
     Mahony KP configuration is now separate between the App Config
     (firmware) and the Refloat Config (package). The App Config KP is now
     used for "true pitch", meaning a standard KP of less than 1 is
     required. (Float used Mahony KP of 0.2, here 0.4 is used, as it seems
     to work better)
     >
     To make the transition seamless and to ensure no misconfiguration
     happens, Refloat will set the following values in App Config -> IMU if
     it detects Mahony KP greater than 1 being configured there:
     >
     - Mahony KP: 0.4
     >
     - Mahony KI: 0
     >
     - Accelerometer Confidence Decay: 0.1
     >
     You don't need to do anything when transitioning from Float package,
     but you can check the values are as described after installation.
     >
     A new Refloat Config item Accelerometer Confidence Decay has been
     added to the package, which is used for the Refloat balance filter.
```

That is, use `>` as a new line marker and indent all lines with a single space.

The `changelog.py` script is used to generate the final changelog (it's not perfect, sometimes minor hand-tuning is needed), you can try to run it to see if your trailer works properly. It processes commits in history until it encounters the first version tag (excluding the HEAD commit even if it is tagged).

## Pull Requests (PRs)
- Each commit should be a single independent change, be functional by itself and not contain unrelated changes.
- Use _rebase workflow_ for all PRs.
- When addressing review comments, if possible, update original commits with fixes belonging to them. Then force-push.

## CI
CI runs on every push to main and needs to pass on every PR. It:
- Runs a build of the package.
- Checks formatting of C sources using `clang-format`.

## Naming Conventions
- Type names are in `PascalCase`.
- Global constants and enum items are in `SCREAMING_CASE`.
- Variables (local, global, struct members) and functions are in `snake_case`.
- File names are in `snake_case.c`.

## Code Formatting
C code is automatically formatted using `clang-format` version 18. You will need to provide this dependency yourself. See: [LLVM releases](https://releases.llvm.org/)

The rest of the code (namely, the QML AppUI sources) is not auto-formatted. Please do your best to adhere to formatting you see surrounding the code you're editing.

You can format C source files via `clang-format` directly e.g. like this (non-recursive):
```sh
clang-format -i src/*.{h,c}
```

But, it's better to use git hooks.

## Git Hooks
Refloat uses `lefthook` for managing git hooks. Again, you will need to provide this dependency yourself. See: [`lefthook` on GitHub](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)

Once `lefthook` is installed, you can install the commit hook in the repo:
```sh
lefthook install
```

After this, `lefthook` will automatically run clang-format on every commit you make and check your formatting.

To auto-fix all formatting of all files in your working tree, run:
```sh
lefthook run clang-format-fix
```
